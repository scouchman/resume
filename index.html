                                <p>Expert in creating effective learning experiences through systematic instructional design processes. Proficient in needs analysis, curriculum development, and learning outcome optimization.</p>

                                <p>I have been using design strategies long enough that my "default muscle memory" is an amalgam of different theories:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        I started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADDIE_Model" target="_blank" title="Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation">ADDIE</a> and still mostly use it, but I have worked in so many fast paced environments that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_design#Rapid_prototyping" target="_blank" title="Successive Approximation Model">SAM</a> is a more useful design process. I will tend to develop everything at once, so slides and script in a lecture webinar or ILT will come together at once.<br><br>
                                        The same applies with elearning. I will usually start with a design concept I want to employ and once I have the idea laid out within the authoring software, I will write the text and more fleshed out design as I go.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        I always use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy"  target="_blank">Bloom's Taxonomy</a> for crafting objectives. I usually have a chart and aim for the higher level items as I think about the objectives. Once I have a good objective in place, it is easy to work with, to refer to and continue with actionable focus. But, if I'm not focused, I often revert back to trying to provide "understanding" vs. actionable items, so I refer back to the charts often at the beginning of a course design.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        I'm a big fan of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Kirkpatrick"  target="_blank">Kirkpatrick</a> Model of evaluation, with my own take on it.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                Level 1 "Smile Sheets": The only thing I really look for in the Reaction level is discontent. If the learners are complaining about the course, there is something wrong with the course and it needs corrected. While the praise given in this level may be nice, the only use I've found for it is a "quick hit" at review times - the things being built are things people will talk about or recommend or come back to. And the only positive evals I would mark would be the incredible praise ones.<br><br>
                                                I have toyed with the idea of using the Level 1 results the same way as an NPS, but it really isn't the same. Better to just use it as a test if there is a course issue.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Level 2 "Did they get it": The quiz! What I like about a multiple choice quiz is that it can easily double as the best course summary you're going to get: Your learners are focused on passing the quiz, so if the questions are written to summarize the important topics and actually assist with the transfer of the material then it has actually done its job. For metrics, it is a quick hit on understanding the learning transfer, but the real importance is providing that focused summary.<br><br>
                                                The Pre-Test/Post Test concept is nice because it will also give the learners the ideas of what the course will be about, what they should be looking for, etc. With elearning (or anything with the online testing component), I am a huge fan of question banks, so the learner won't be able to just memorize the questions and the answers since they may not see that question again. The big trick to this is that question banks should be arranged by topics so both the pre-course test wiifm and the post-course test summary will still apply.<br><br>
                                                I love creating quizzes, but they often are one of the hardest steps to do correctly.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Level 3 "Are they using it?": Level 3 & 4 <em>can</em> get a little blurred, but essentially with Level 3, I see if the learner is "excited" enough to start applying the concepts learned immediately. With internal training, their management (or staff, if it is a leadership course) can see the difference and report back their findings. If it is a technical course, it will show in how they work with the tool. For clients in a SaaS environment, are they accessing and applying the skills immediately.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                Level 4 "They got it!": After a month or more, are the learners still utilizing what they learned in the course. Before the course even starts, there should be a hypothesis to what would a change in the status quo look like. If they have exceeded the status quo within a certain timeframe, the course and training can be viewed as a success.<br><br>
                                                I have been studying more on ROI within training and it expands this step exponetially. In some models, they have added three more levels to the standard Kirkpatrick which is great, but often a full time job in and of itself to track and evaluate.

                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        To me, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition" target="_blank">Dreyfus model of skill acquisition</a> is similar to Bloom's Taxonomy in application. I do not believe in it's binary approach, but the concepts behind it are good focus points for design: Recollection (non-situational or situational), Recognition (decomposed or holistic),Decision (analytical or intuitive), Awareness (monitoring or absorbed)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        While I hadn't heard about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Mager#Criterion_Referenced_Instruction_%28CRI%29" target="_blank">Criterion Referenced Instruction (Robert Mager)</a> method until recently, I have essentially used it most of my career. The first four are the only way to not overwhelm a learner (or the Instructional Designer!) with too much information. The last point is one I try to incorporate in everything I create. You may <em>need</em> to cover specific topics, but to hook the learners into the course/material, they will want to pick what interests them most first. And then they will be invested.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Objectives from job performance/competencies</li>
                                            <li>Practice only what's not mastered</li>
                                            <li>Practice and provide feedback</li>
                                            <li>Repeat practice</li>
                                            <li>Sandbox learning</li>

                                    <li>
                                        Like Mager's methodology above, I have mostly performed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditions_of_Learning" target="_blank">Gagné's Nine Levels of Learning</a> intuitively based on years of learning instructional design on the job. With the model available it is useful when a course is not "flowing" correctly, or not connecting with the learners.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        There are other methodologies that I have picked tools from, but since it is a amalgam of these to my style, I either didn't know I was using that style or just don't remember the structuring of it. <em>There is always room for growth!</em>
                                    </li>

                                <p>Authoring Systems known:</p>

                                <p>With my design philosophy, I prefer the more robust tools to realize my ideas, but I fully understand the levels of course design where:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The basic and fastest design is essentially recreating slide decks and lectures within an authoring system. You won't have a great transfer of knowledge with this form, but the content is available and running for learners.</li>
                                    <li>The "normal" elearning can incorporate videos, simple interactions and games, etc. Often very template based, so a wide variety of courses developed quickly with this method will look the same. To me, this is the "good enough" level. It does the job, it isn't great, but has a little flexibility to experiment and you can put out courses relatively quickly once you've standardized the process.</li>
                                    <li>The advanced elearning is what every designer should strive for and every stakeholder should actually want. This is a custom training design to fit the needs. Threaded quizzing, sandbox exploration, advanced games, downloadables, and other interactions. It will likely have inline video and more. The main issue is that it takes the most time to develop. With enough time at a job, the Instructional Designer can have a portfolio of designs to start with, so it will cut down some of the development time, but it will still take the most time.</li>

                                <p>Proficient in implementing, managing, and optimizing various Learning Management Systems. Experienced in content integration, user management, and analytics reporting.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>LearnUpon:</strong> Converted JoomlaLMS to LearnUpon. Responsible for acquiring, implementing, maintaining and updating. Maintained reports on certifications, teams and course data.</li>
                                    <li><strong>JoomlaLMS:</strong> The version we used was slightly broken when I started (no advanced reporting, small course sizes), but we limped along. This actually allowed me to understand many of the intricacies of how an LMS functions to allow me to roll back errors and troubleshoot issues.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Litmos:</strong> I started working with Litmos in an existing system. We were implementing different levels of access including paid/free and different login options. The course uploads/updates and reporting were relatively standard.</li>
                                    <li><strong>SAP LMS:</strong> The version of this LMS we used was so customized it was basically unrecognizable from the main system. This was the system SAP used before they purchased and switched to Litmos (and then sold off Litmos in 2022). In the search to replace JoomlaLMS, the SAP LMS and Litmos were both demoed.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Docebo:</strong> Docebo (and Crowd Wisdom) were both in process to be the company LMS when there was a change in leadership, so it never went out of the testing phase. I had gone through a basic design set up and testing of different types of elearning modules. I was looking forward to fully exploring Docebo since it appears to be one of the few that has an integrated social element.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Crowd Wisdom:</strong> Crowd Wisdom appeared to be a great LMS that we were in process to make the company LMS when there was a change in leadership and the project was canceled. I had gone through a basic design set up and testing of different types of elearning modules.</li>
                                    <li><em>Occasionally worked with other and niche systems.</em></li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>In my experience, most Learning Management Systems are very similar in operation. Usually on evaluating them, it is best to quickly run through the standard operations to make sure there's nothing strange (like the version of JoomlaLMS not allowing files larger than 37MB) and then seeing what special features make the LMS stand out: Different ways of handling videos vs SCORM vs quizzing, certification and gamification/badging, paid and free options, social elements, etc.</p>
